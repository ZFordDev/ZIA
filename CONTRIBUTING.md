# How to Contribute
Thanks for your interest in improving ZIA! 🎉  
This project is built in public, and contributions of all sizes are welcome — whether it’s fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation.

---

## How to Contribute
- **Fork the repo** and create a branch for your changes.  
- Keep commits **clear and clean** — one logical change per commit is ideal.  
- Write commit messages in **imperative mood** (e.g., `Add modular memory handler`).  
- Open a **pull request (PR)** with a description of what you changed and why.

---

## Reporting Issues
- Use the **Issues tab** to report bugs or suggest improvements.  
- Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots/logs if possible.  
- If you’re unsure whether it’s a bug or feature request, open an issue anyway — discussion helps.

---

## Coding Guidelines
- Follow the existing style in the codebase.  
- Document new modules and configs clearly.  
- Keep changes modular — avoid mixing unrelated fixes/features in one PR.  
- For experimental features, isolate them so they don’t break core functionality.

---

## Testing
- Run ZIA locally before submitting changes.  
- Make sure your changes don’t break existing functionality.  
- Add tests where possible, especially for new modules or integrations.

---

## Community Standards
- Respect the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  
- Collaboration happens via [Discord](https://discord.gg/4RGzagyt7C).  
- Be constructive, inclusive, and professional in discussions.

---

## Security
